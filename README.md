# ðŸ“š Interactive Book Review Websites

This repository contains a collection of interactive book review websites built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can view them live via GitHub Pages (e.g., [BASB](https://kanishmadhav-wizard.github.io/Books/BASB/), [Digital minimalism](https://kanishmadhav-wizard.github.io/Books/Digital%20Minimalism/)). To try them locally, clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git`, navigate to any folder, and open `index.html` in your browser.
